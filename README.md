## Minecraft City Saves

A collection of world backups from my Minecraft city I've been working on since 2017.

NOTE: Working on adding saves that are larger than 25MB due to limitations with GitHub.

### Notable Locations
- UT Austin Campus
- One World Trade Center
- US Capitol Building
- White House
- Supreme Court Building
- And more!

### Instructions for Windows 10 Edition
1. Download a .mcworld file from the repo
2. Open the file from where you downloaded it. Enjoy!

### Instructions for Java Edition
1. Download a .mcworld file from the repo
2. Create a new infinite world in Java edition
3. Use a world converter to convert the world from a .mcworld file into the new Java world
- Recommended to use [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/)
4. You can now open the world in Java Edition. Enjoy!

### What if I don't have Minecraft?
Don't have Minecraft but still want to see the world? Use [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/) to see the world in 3D
or use [Unmined](https://unmined.net/) if you want an overhead map view.

TIP: Use Minecraft [shaders](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/) for a better look in Java Edition.
