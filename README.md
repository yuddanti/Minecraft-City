### What if I don't have Minecraft?
Don't have Minecraft but still want to see the world? Use [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/) to see the world in 3D
or use [Unmined](https://unmined.net/) if you want an overhead map view.

TIP: Use Minecraft [shaders](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/) for a better look in Java Edition.
